This code solves the problem of counting the number of paths from the top-left square to the bottom-right square in an n x n grid, where some squares may contain traps (represented by the character '#'). You can only move right or down.

## Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer N representing the size of the grid.
The following N lines each contain a string of length N representing a row of the grid. Characters in the string are either '.' (empty square) or '*' (trap).
## Output:

The output prints a single integer representing the number of valid paths from the top-left square to the bottom-right square, modulo 10^9 + 7 (to avoid overflow for large grids).
## Algorithm:

The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. It creates a table dp of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) to store the number of valid paths to reach each square in the grid. The table is filled iteratively:

Base Case: 
dp[1][1] is set to 1 (there's only 1 way to reach the top-left square, which is by starting there).
Iterate over the grid:
For each square (i, j) (except the top-left corner):
If the current square is not a trap (.):
The number of paths to reach this square is the sum of the number of paths to reach the squares directly above (dp[i - 1][j]) and to the left (dp[i][j - 1]) of the current square, considering only valid squares (not traps).
Store the calculated number of paths for the current square dp[i][j] in the table.
Answer: The number of paths to reach the bottom-right square dp[N][N] is the final answer.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to iterating over all squares in the grid.
Space Complexity: O(n^2) due to the size of the dp table.
